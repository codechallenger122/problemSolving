1. 백트래킹이란 무엇인가?

  Backtracking can be defined as a "general algorithmic technique" 
  that considers "searching every possible combination" in order to solve a computational problem. 
  : 가능한 모든 combination 을 search 하는 일반적인 알고리즘을 BackTracking 이라 한다.

  Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally,
  one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time

  (1) Decision Problem     – In this, we search for a "feasible solution".
  (2) Optimization Problem – In this, we search for the "best solution".
  (3) Enumeration Problem  – In this, we find "all feasible solutions".
